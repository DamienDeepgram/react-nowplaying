# React NowPlaying

[![Discord](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/xWRaCDBtW4?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/xWRaCDBtW4)

A cross-browser cross-device friendly React context to auto-play audio in a browser.

## Demo / Development

This repo has a self-contained demo that does not get bundled with the package. To run this locally, you simply need to do the following;

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# run local demo
npm run dev
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm i react-nowplaying
```

### Add to your project

Import the React context provider;

```tsx
import { NowPlayingContextProvider } from "react-nowplaying";
```

And, just as any custom context provider, wrap the part of your app you need to be context aware in the custom provider's tags.

```tsx
// layout.tsx

//...

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <NowPlayingContextProvider>{children}</NowPlayingContextProvider> // e.g. custom provider tags wrap entire body of app
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Now, you can provide your data `Blob` to the play function.

```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  const { play } = useNowPlaying();

  const playAudio = () => {
    // get your audio blob
    play(blob, "audio/mp3");
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => playAudio()}>
      Play Audio
    </button>
  );
}
```

## How It Works

In our recent project, we faced challenges with automatically playing audio across different browsers and devices, including Safari, Firefox, and all iOS devices. Our solution involved complex adjustments to enable automatic playback of audio files (in Blob format) received from our API. Instead of utilizing the Web Audio API, we opted for a workaround that involves a hidden audio element on the webpage. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- When audio is ready to play, the webpage updates a hidden audio element with the audio source and type, allowing the audio to play automatically.
- We created a custom hook that mimics the audio controls you'd find in the Web Audio API, making it easier to manage playback. This includes features for playing and finishing, with callbacks named onPlay and onFinish to handle these actions.
- Additionally, this custom hook provides a player object, which can be used to attach custom event handlers for more advanced audio control.

This approach allows for seamless audio playback across a wide range of browsers and devices, ensuring users have a consistent experience.
